Program to calculate metrics (total return, forward_return, forward returns 1y/3y/5y/10y, ROA, EBIT/PPE, EBIT/PPE TTM, Gross Margin, Operating Margin, EV/EBIT, Relative PS, 5-Year Revenue CAGR) from nasdaq_data.jsonl
and save results to metrics.json
forward_return = Annualized return from period j+2 to most recent period (skips j+1 to avoid look-ahead bias from financial reporting lag)
Forward returns 1y/3y/5y/10y are annualized returns calculated for 1 year (4 quarters), 3 years (12 quarters), 5 years (20 quarters), and 10 years (40 quarters)
All forward returns start at t+2 (not t+1) to avoid look-ahead bias, as t+1 includes the quarter when financial information from t would be released
All forward returns are annualized
EBIT/PPE = Operating Income / PPE (Property, Plant, and Equipment) - quarterly
EBIT/PPE TTM = Sum of Operating Income from quarters t, t-1, t-2, t-3 / Sum of PPE from quarters t, t-1, t-2, t-3
Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue
Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue
EV/EBIT = Enterprise Value / EBIT (Operating Income)
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents
Relative PS = Current Price-to-Sales / 5-Year Average Price-to-Sales (20 quarters)
5-Year Revenue CAGR = Revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate over 5 years (20 quarters), calculated as ((Current Revenue / Revenue 5 Years Ago)^(1/5) - 1) * 100
